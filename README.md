## 💡 What It Does

HyroxGPT is an intelligent system that analyzes race performance data from Hyrox competitions and generates personalized feedback for athletes. It combines classical machine learning with LLM fine-tuning techniques to deliver insights such as:

- Whether the athlete over- or under-performed vs expected  
- What their cluster/group performance looks like  
- Recommendations for improvement

## 🗂️ Project Structure

### 📊 `1.Hyrox_ML/` — Machine Learning Performance Analysis

**📄 File:**
- `Hyrox_ML.ipynb`

This notebook contains the first stage of the project where:

- Raw Hyrox results were preprocessed and converted into numerical features  
- Feature engineering was applied (z-scores, MinMax scaling, clustering)  
- Models (Linear Regression and LightGBM) were trained to predict total race time  
- An intermediate `performance_feedback` column was generated, used later for LLM fine-tuning

### 🤖 `2.Fine-Tuning/` — LLM Fine-Tuning (GPT-2 and Mistral-7B + LoRA)

**📄 Files:**
- `Hyrox_Fine_tuning_GPT2.ipynb`
- `Hyrox_Fine_tuning_Mistral7B_LoRA.ipynb`

This folder contains attempts at fine-tuning language models to generate more human-like feedback:

- **GPT-2** was used in the first iteration. It was easy to train but limited in expressiveness and generalization  
- **Mistral-7B + LoRA** was later explored to improve output quality, but training was interrupted due to limited Colab GPU time and missing configuration (offload folder)  
- Instruction-style prompts were created from the ML feedback for use in model training
